# Iris-Classification
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on sepal and petal measurements. The project includes data exploration, visualization, model training, and performance evaluation using Python.

Key Highlights:
Used the built-in Iris dataset from Scikit-learn
Performed data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib
Trained and tested a KNN classifier
Evaluated the model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix

Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Purpose:
This project is designed for beginners to understand the complete machine learning workflow and is suitable for academic learning and resume projects.
